# Weather Dashboard

This project is a simple weather dashboard built with React that consumes the OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API.  
Users can search for a city and see real-time weather information such as temperature, feels-like temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the conditions.
